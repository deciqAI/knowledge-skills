description: "Activate when: user says 'challenge my thinking', 'play devil's advocate', 'what's the strongest counter-argument', 'ACH', 'analysis of competing hypotheses'; user needs to evaluate a high-stakes claim or decision with multiple possible interpretations; user suspects motivated reasoning or a team is converging too fast on one answer.
  Do NOT activate when: the claim is trivial or already well-validated; the decision is about values rather than facts (use regret-minimization or first-principles instead)."

# Critical Thinking

## Overview

**Critical thinking** evaluates a conclusion by **explicitly testing it against alternative interpretations** — the conclusion that survives the most disconfirmation attempts is the one to act on, not the one with the most confirming examples. Operationalized by **Richards J. Heuer Jr.** (CIA, 1999) as **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)**: a matrix marking each evidence-hypothesis pair as Consistent / Inconsistent / N/A. The hypothesis with the **fewest Inconsistencies** wins.

**Compose:** [first-principles](../first-principles/SKILL.md) (surface assumptions) · [probabilistic-thinking](../probabilistic-thinking/SKILL.md) (calibrate evidence) · [inversion](../inversion/SKILL.md) (generate alternatives). Critical thinking = *evaluation*; first-principles = *construction*; occams = *selection*; second-order = *projection*.

## When to Use

- High-stakes claim (yours or someone else's) that needs evaluation
- Multiple interpretations of the same evidence are possible
- Motivated reasoning detected — conclusion shaped by what you want to be true
- Team converging on a hypothesis too fast without seriously considering alternatives

**When NOT to use:** trivial/already-validated claim; only one hypothesis imaginable (use [first-principles](../first-principles/SKILL.md) first); time pressure makes 90-min ACH impossible; values question not a facts question.

## Coaching Novices (Adaptive Front Door)

- **Engine mode:** user has a concrete claim + evidence → run The Process directly.
- **Coach mode:** user is unfamiliar or has no concrete case → guide step by step.
In Coach mode, respond one step at a time. Each [WAIT] is a hard stop — output only that step's question, then stop.
1. One-line what-it-is: critical thinking is **testing your conclusion against alternative explanations**, looking for the one with the **fewest unresolved contradictions** — not the most confirming examples.
2. Check fit against When to Use / When NOT to use. Redirect if trivial or values-only.
3. Elicit the specific claim under evaluation — "I want to evaluate my thinking" is too vague; need a *specific* claim. > **[WAIT — do not advance until user responds]**
4. Walk through ACH steps one at a time with their input: list hypotheses → list evidence → score matrix → identify survivor. > **[WAIT — do not advance until user responds]**
5. Close by naming the most-diagnostic evidence they discovered — the piece that most differentiates hypotheses. > **[WAIT — do not advance until user responds]**

## The Process

Run **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** — Heuer's 8-step procedure.
1. **Identify hypotheses.** Brainstorm broadly — obvious, contrarian, and 2-3 in between. Generate at least 3 alternatives.
2. **List significant evidence** for and against each hypothesis — include absence of expected evidence.
3. **Prepare the matrix**: hypotheses across top, evidence down side. Mark each cell **C / I / N/A**. *Load-bearing step.*
4. **Refine the matrix.** Remove evidence consistent with all hypotheses (no discriminating value). Focus where hypotheses disagree.
5. **Draw tentative conclusions.** Count **Inconsistent** marks — the hypothesis with the **fewest I marks** is the survivor.
6. **Sensitivity analysis.** If the most-important evidence were wrong, would the conclusion change? Identify linchpin assumptions.
7. **Report conclusions** — alternatives considered, why rejected, and linchpin assumptions explicitly stated.
8. **Set milestones** for future observation that may indicate events are taking a different course.

### Output: the ACH Matrix

```
Hypotheses: H1 / H2 / H3 (≥3)
Evidence: E1, E2, E3 … (include absence of expected evidence)
Matrix: mark each cell C / I / N/A
Inconsistencies count: H1=2, H2=3, H3=0 → H3 survives
Linchpin assumptions: "If E2 were wrong, conclusion flips to H1"
Alternatives rejected: H1 because E2+E5; H2 because E1+E4
Milestones: "If X observed by <date>, re-run matrix"
```

## Analysis Packs

Domain packs (canonical hypotheses, diagnostic evidence, typical bias, matrix conventions):
- **Intel:** state intentions/capabilities; HUMINT/SIGINT/IMINT; bias = mirror-imaging.
- **Medical:** differentials; history + labs + imaging; bias = premature closure.
- **Business/investment:** market thesis alternatives; data + qualitative signals; bias = motivated reasoning.
- **Engineering:** root-cause candidates; logs + repro steps; bias = fixing the visible symptom layer.

## Applying It Well

- **Alternatives before evidence** — listing evidence first lets your initial hypothesis shape selection.
- **Fewest Inconsistencies beats most Consistencies** — Heuer's central insight.
- **Diagnostic evidence > confirmatory** — evidence consistent with all hypotheses doesn't discriminate.
- **Name linchpin assumptions** — without naming what would change your mind, the analysis is not falsifiable.
- **Re-run as evidence accumulates** — Cuba 1962 failure was partly about never revisiting NIE 85-3-62.

## Common Rationalizations

**[D] = designed upfront | [O] = observed in real use. [O] entries are more valuable.**

| Fake move | Reality |
|---|---|
| [D] **Only one hypothesis considered** | The most common failure. If "there aren't any plausible alternatives," generate them via [first-principles](../first-principles/SKILL.md) before continuing. |
| [D] **Counting Consistent marks** instead of Inconsistent marks | Confirmatory evidence often supports multiple hypotheses; what differentiates is the disconfirming evidence. |
| [D] **Skipping the matrix** because "I can do this in my head" | The matrix exists *because* unaided reasoning systematically anchors on the first hypothesis. |
| [D] **Discarding evidence that contradicts the favored hypothesis** | Mark it Inconsistent. Discarding it means the matrix is rigged. |
| [D] **Confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence** | If H1 predicts X and you don't see X, that's diagnostic — mark Inconsistent for H1. |
| [D] **No linchpin assumptions stated** | If you cannot name what would change your conclusion, it is not falsifiable. |
| [D] **Confirmation bias laundered as "intuition"** | "My intuition says H1" + writing up analysis to confirm H1 is the Sherman Kent 1962 failure mode. |
| [D] **Motivated reasoning about the cost of being wrong** | Hypotheses implying painful actions are systematically under-weighted. Recognize and over-correct. |
| [D] **One-shot analysis, never revisited** | New evidence requires re-running. The Cuba failure was partly about not revisiting NIE 85-3-62. |
| *→ Add [O] entries here after each real use — paste the actual failure pattern* | *What went wrong and why* |

## Red Flags

- Only one hypothesis is being considered
- "Supporting evidence" accumulated without checking against alternatives
- Conclusion reached before the analysis (motivated reasoning)
- No matrix or equivalent structured comparison exists
- No statement of linchpin assumptions / what would change the conclusion
- Disconfirming evidence explained away ("yes, but...") rather than entered into the matrix
- Analysis done once and never revisited as new evidence arrived

## Verification

- [ ] At least 3 hypotheses are explicitly listed
- [ ] Evidence is enumerated independently of any hypothesis preference
- [ ] Each evidence-hypothesis pair is marked C / I / N/A
- [ ] The matrix focuses on Inconsistencies, not Consistencies
- [ ] Diagnostic evidence (where hypotheses disagree) is highlighted
- [ ] Surviving hypothesis is the one with fewest Inconsistencies
- [ ] Linchpin assumptions are explicitly named
- [ ] Milestones for re-evaluation are set
